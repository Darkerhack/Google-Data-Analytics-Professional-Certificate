In this case study, you'll be delving into the world of data analysis as a member of the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a fictional bike-share company based in Chicago.

Your recommendations must be data-driven and supported by compelling insights and professional data visualizations in order to gain approval from Cyclistic executives.
